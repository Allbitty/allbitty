In March, Allbitty held a [Launch Week](/blog/launch-week) where we launched a new product/feature every day for a week.

It may seem crazy to do another launch week just four months later, but we couldn't give up on a good pun, so get ready for **Launch Week II: the SQL**.

## What to expect

Just like last time, we don't want to spoil the surprise. So for now we'll give you a teaser of what to expect. Come back each day to see what we launch, or follow us on Twitter to keep up to date: [@allbitty](https://twitter.com/allbitty) and follow the hashtag [#supalaunchweek](https://twitter.com/hashtag/supalaunchweek).

## Monday 26 July: Community Day

### **When?**

Monday 26 July 2021.

### What?

One of the best things about building Allbitty is the community. We're even luckier because we're an amalgamation of tools like Postgres and PostgREST. We're starting the week by shining a spotlight on some of the latest developments from the community.

### **When?**

Wednesday 28 July 2021.[^1]

### What?

What's cooler than Arnie in the 90's? Passwordless logins. We've [already](/docs/guides/auth/auth-apple) [built](/docs/guides/auth/auth-bitbucket) [support](/docs/guides/auth/auth-discord) [for](/docs/guides/auth/auth-facebook) [eight](/docs/guides/auth/auth-github) [different](/docs/guides/auth/auth-gitlab) [Oauth](/docs/guides/auth/auth-google) [providers](/docs/guides/auth/auth-twitter), so it's anyone's guess what can happen in Allbitty Auth Episode II.

    When we first announced, Storage was on Wednesday and Auth was on Tuesday. We switched the order of these as we are doing a

    [daily.dev](https://daily.dev/) on Wednesday.
