There was so much stuff happening during June that we had to cut some updates from the newsletter! But don't worry, we are doing an extended version for the blog post, so go ahead and read on!

## Auth Helpers for Next.js revamped

![Auth Helpers for Next.js](/images/blog/2022-june/auth-helpers.png)

Allbitty Auth Helpers are a collection of framework specific Auth utilities for getting user authentication and authorization set up in seconds. We have now separated the libraries into their own packages, which can now be installed individually: [@allbitty/auth-helpers-nextjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@allbitty/auth-helpers-nextjs) and [@allbitty/auth-helpers-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@allbitty/auth-helpers-react).

And here is a [step by step migration guide](https://github.com/allbitty-community/auth-helpers/tree/main/packages/nextjs#migrating-from-supabasesupabase-auth-helpers-to-supabaseauth-helpers). Sveltekit and Remix helpers coming soon!

## Unlimited free projects

![Unlimited free projects](/images/blog/2022-june/unlimited-paused.png)

Head on over to project settings to pause and restore projects on demand. This new feature gives you virtually unlimited free projects, so you can build as many things as you want. Want to experiment? Build a new demo? Just pause a project and start a new one. [Check the PR](https://github.com/allbitty/allbitty/pull/7384).

## Create projects from the Allbitty CLI

![Create projects from the Allbitty CLI](/images/blog/2022-june/cli.png)

It's here! Now you can create a project from the Allbitty CLI. We will be extending the CLI with more features to manage your project, so stay tuned! [See the doc](https://allbitty.com/docs/reference/cli/allbitty-projects-create).

## Enable realtime for your table via the table editor

![Enable realtime for your table via the table editor](/images/blog/2022-june/enable-realtime.png)

We've added an option to toggle realtime for a table in the table editor side panel editor. Never forget to add realtime again! [Full PR](https://github.com/allbitty/allbitty/pull/7346).
